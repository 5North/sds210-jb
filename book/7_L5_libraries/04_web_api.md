```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

You do not need to download every dataset you want to analyze.

**APIs** allow your code to ask web servers for exactly the data you need, right when you need it.

```

So far, we have worked with tools and data running locally on your computer. But the true power of spatial data science unlocks when your code can talk to the rest of the world.

In this section, you will learn how to write Python code that fetches live information from external servers, such as real-time weather data, without ever opening a web browser.

---

## 1. Introduction to Web APIs

An API (Application Programming Interface) is essentially a set of rules that allows one program to talk to another program. Many modern websites, scientific institutions, and government agencies provide an API so that developers can query their databases in an automated way.

For spatial analysis, Web APIs are critical. They allow you to access massive computing resources without running heavy operations on your own machine. Common spatial use cases include:

* Getting real-time weather data for specific coordinates.
* Converting street addresses into coordinates (geocoding).
* Getting driving directions and routing between places.
* Downloading specific slices of massive satellite datasets.

Most spatial {term}`API`s use a standard called {abbr}`REST (Representational State Transfer)`, meaning you interact with them over standard web protocols ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)), exactly like your web browser does when loading a page.

---

## 2. The requests module

To query a server, your code needs to send a request over the internet and wait for a response. The community-built `requests` module is the absolute standard for doing this in Python.

When you send a request, the server sends back a response containing both the data and a **status code**. The status code tells you if your request was successful (Code 200 means "OK").

```{code-cell} python
import requests

# Ask a web server for its homepage
response = requests.get('[https://objectiveunclear.com/](https://objectiveunclear.com/)')

# Check if the request was successful
print(response.status_code)

```

---

## 3. Understanding JSON

When an API sends data back to you, it almost always uses a format called **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation). [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is the universal language for data exchange on the web. Conveniently, it looks and behaves almost exactly like nested Python dictionaries and lists.

*(Note: When dealing with vector shapes like polygons, APIs use a spatial flavor of this format called GeoJSON. We will explore GeoJSON later in the course.)*

The `requests` module has a built-in `.json()` method that automatically converts the raw text response from the server directly into a Python dictionary that you can navigate.

```{code-cell} python
# Assuming 'response' is a successful request holding JSON data
data = response.json()

# Access data using standard dictionary keys
print(data['temperature'])

```

---

## 4. Fetching live weather data (JSON)

Let us look at a real-world example using the **Open-Meteo API**. This is a free, open-source weather API that requires no authentication key, making it perfect for learning.

We want to find out the current temperature in Zurich. To do this, we need to pass the latitude and longitude of the city to the API. We do this by creating a `parameters` dictionary and handing it to the `requests.get()` function.

```{code-cell} python
import requests

# 1. Define the API endpoint URL
api_url = "[https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast](https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast)"

# 2. Define our query parameters (Zurich coordinates)
parameters = {
    "latitude": 47.37,
    "longitude": 8.54,
    "current_weather": "true"
}

# 3. Send the GET request
response = requests.get(api_url, params=parameters)

# 4. Check the status and extract the data
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request successful!")
    
    # Convert the JSON response into a Python dictionary
    data = response.json()
    
    # Navigate the dictionary to find the temperature
    current_temp = data["current_weather"]["temperature"]
    
    print(f"The current temperature in Zurich is {current_temp}°C")
else:
    print("Request failed.")
    print("Reason:", response.text) 

```

By changing the latitude and longitude in the `parameters` dictionary, you can instantly fetch the current weather for anywhere on Earth.

> *If you are curious, inspect the `data["current_weather"]` dictionary to see which other weather parameters are included, like `windspeed` and `winddirection`.*

---

## 5. Fetching historical climate data (CSV)

In the previous example, the Open-Meteo API returned data in JSON format. However, many government portals and scientific institutions provide their open data directly as text files, such as CSVs (Comma-Separated Values).

The `requests` module does not care what type of file it is downloading; it simply fetches the raw text from the server.

Let us look at the **MeteoSwiss Open Government Data (OGD)** portal. They provide historical climate data for stations all across Switzerland.

We want to download the **monthly aggregations** for the weather station at Kloten (Zurich Airport, station code `KLO`). The dataset contains dozens of parameters (wind, rain, radiation), but we only want to extract the **average monthly temperature** (parameter `tre200m0`) for the year **1953**.

Because we have not learned how to use advanced data libraries like `pandas` yet, we will fetch the data and use basic Python string methods to filter it.

```{code-cell} python
import requests

# 1. Define the URL for the Kloten (KLO) monthly CSV file
# Notice the 'm' at the end of the filename for 'monthly'
csv_url = "[https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.ogd-smn/klo/ogd-smn_klo_m.csv](https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.ogd-smn/klo/ogd-smn_klo_m.csv)"

# 2. Fetch the data
response = requests.get(csv_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Download successful!\n")
    
    # 3. Extract raw text (do NOT use .json() here)
    csv_text = response.text
    
    # 4. Split the massive text block into a list of individual lines
    lines = csv_text.splitlines()
    
    # 5. Loop through all lines and filter for the year 1953
    print("Average Monthly Temperatures in Kloten (1953):")
    print("-" * 50)
    for line in lines:
        if "1953" in line:
            # MeteoSwiss separates columns with a semicolon (;)
            # Let's split the line into a list of values
            columns = line.split(";")
            
            # The date is the 2nd column (index 1)
            date = columns[1]
            # The average temperature is the 3rd column (index 2)
            temp = columns[2]
            
            print(f"{date}: {temp}°C")
            
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}")

```

If you run this code, you will see exactly 12 lines of data (one for each month of 1953).

While we *can* use basic string tools like `.splitlines()` and `.split(";")` to read a CSV, doing complex data analysis this way is tedious. Later on, you will learn how to use the `pandas` library to turn these raw CSV strings into powerful, analyzable data tables!

## 6. API rate limiting

Computers are fast. It is very easy to write a loop that sends thousands of queries per second to check the weather in every city globally. Servers cannot handle that much traffic from a single user, so API providers enforce **rate limiting**.

If you send too many requests too fast, the server will reject them and return an error code (often HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests").

### The time module

To prevent your code from moving too fast and getting blocked, you can use the `time` module from the Python Standard Library. The `time.sleep()` function forces your code to pause for a specified number of seconds before continuing.

```{code-cell} python
import time

for x in range(3):
    print(f"Sending request {x}...")
    # Pause for 1 second to respect rate limits
    time.sleep(1)

```

By adding `time.sleep()` inside your data-fetching loops, you ensure your program plays nicely with the API provider's rules.

## 7. Exercises

Practice fetching data and handling rate limits with these exercises.

### Exercise 1: Finding the windiest megacity

We want to find out which of the world's 10 most populated cities is currently experiencing the strongest winds. We can do this by looping through a dictionary of cities, calling the Open-Meteo API for each one, and extracting the wind speed.

Since we are sending 10 requests in a row, we must respect the server's rate limits by pausing between each request.

1. Review the code block in Section 4 above to see how the API is called.
2. Below, we have provided a dictionary containing the names and coordinates of the 10 most populated cities.
3. Write a `for` loop that iterates through the `megacities` dictionary using `.items()`.
4. Inside the loop, create a new `parameters` dictionary using the latitude and longitude of the current city. Set `"current_weather": "true"`.
5. Send the `requests.get()` command and parse the JSON response.
6. Extract the `windspeed` value from the `current_weather` dictionary and print it alongside the city name.
7. Add `time.sleep(0.5)` at the very end of your loop to pause for half a second before the next city is processed.


```{code-cell} python
import requests
import time

api_url = "[https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast](https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast)"

# City name as the key, a tuple of (latitude, longitude) as the value
megacities = {
    "Tokyo": (35.687, 139.7495),
    "Jakarta": (-6.175, 106.8275),
    "Delhi": (28.61, 77.23),
    "Guangzhou": (23.13, 113.26),
    "Mumbai": (19.0761, 72.8775),
    "Manila": (14.5958, 120.9772),
    "Shanghai": (31.2286, 121.4747),
    "Sao Paulo": (-23.5504, -46.6339),
    "Seoul": (37.5667, 126.9833),
    "Mexico City": (19.4333, -99.1333)
}

# Your loop goes here


```

}

for city_name, coords in megacities.items():
    
    # 1. Build the parameters for this specific city
    parameters = {
        "latitude": coords[0],
        "longitude": coords[1],
        "current_weather": "true"
    }
    
    # 2. Make the request
    response = requests.get(api_url, params=parameters)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        
        # 3. Extract the wind speed
        wind_speed = data["current_weather"]["windspeed"]
        
        # 4. Print the result
        print(f"{city_name}: {wind_speed} km/h")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data for {city_name}")
        
    # 5. Respect the rate limit
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

**Key idea:**
Combining loops, dictionaries, and `time.sleep()` allows you to automate repetitive spatial queries without overwhelming external servers.

### Exercise 2: Climate change at the Weissfluhjoch

Let us practice fetching CSV data from MeteoSwiss. This time, we want to look at the high-alpine station at Weissfluhjoch above Davos (station code `WFJ`).

Instead of looking at monthly data for a single year, we want to look at the **yearly average temperatures** since 1981 to see if we can spot a warming trend.

MeteoSwiss provides yearly aggregations in a separate file ending in `_y.csv` instead of `_m.csv`.

1. Create a variable `csv_url` pointing to the **yearly** CSV file for Weissfluhjoch (`wfj`).
*(Hint: Look at the URL structure in Section 5 and change `klo` to `wfj`, and `_m.csv` to `_y.csv`)*.
2. Make a `requests.get()` call to this URL.
3. Extract the raw text using `response.text`.
4. Break the text into a list of lines using `.splitlines()`.
5. Write a `for` loop to iterate through the list of lines.
6. Inside the loop, check if the string `"WFJ"` is in the line (to skip the header and only process data rows).
7. If it is a data row, split the line using `.split(";")`.
8. Extract the year (index `1`) and the average temperature (index `2`), and print them.

```{code-cell} python

```

``````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
import requests

# 1. Update the URL for Weissfluhjoch (wfj) and yearly data (_y)
csv_url = "[https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.ogd-smn/wfj/ogd-smn_wfj_y.csv](https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.ogd-smn/wfj/ogd-smn_wfj_y.csv)"

# 2. Fetch the data
response = requests.get(csv_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    
    # 3 & 4. Extract and split the text
    csv_text = response.text
    lines = csv_text.splitlines()
    
    print("Weissfluhjoch Annual Average Temperatures:")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    # 5. Loop through the lines
    for line in lines:
        
        # 6. Skip the header row
        if "WFJ" in line:
            
            # 7. Split the row into columns
            columns = line.split(";")
            
            # 8. Extract the year and temperature
            year = columns[1]
            temp = columns[2]
            
            print(f"{year}: {temp}°C")
            
else:
    print("Failed to fetch the CSV file.")
```

**Key idea:**
API endpoints are often highly structured. By understanding how the URL is built (`.../station_code/ogd-smn_station_code_granularity.csv`), you can easily swap out parameters to fetch different datasets without needing a complex search interface.

## 8. Summary

In this section, you learned how to break out of your local machine and fetch dynamic spatial data from the web.

### Key ideas

* **APIs** allow your code to talk to external servers automatically.
* The `requests` module makes sending queries and receiving data simple.
* Data on the web is heavily exchanged using **JSON**.
* You extract data from a response by parsing the JSON into a standard Python dictionary using `.json()`.
* **Rate limiting** is critical. You must use `time.sleep()` to slow down your loops and respect the provider's server limits.
