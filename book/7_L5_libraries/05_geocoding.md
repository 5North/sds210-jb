```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

We understand the world through names and addresses. Computers understand the world through geometry and coordinates.

**Geocoding** is the bridge that translates human places into machine locations.
```

In the previous section, we used coordinates to fetch weather data from an API. In the real world, however, you may not receive a dataset that is perfectly formatted with latitudes and longitudes. Instead, you may get a list of street addresses, city names, or famous landmarks.

In this section, you will learn how to convert place names into geographic coordinates so you can map them, and how to do the exact reverse.

## 1. What is geocoding?

Geocoding is the process of transforming a text description of a location (like "42 Rue du Languedoc, 31000 Toulouse, France") into a spatial representation (like `latitude: 43.5983, longitude: 1.4457`).

Under the hood, geocoding relies heavily on the Web APIs we just learned about. When you ask a program to geocode an address, it sends a request to a massive database of geographic data (like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap). The server searches its database, finds the matching coordinates, and sends the geometry back to you.

---

## 2. Geocoding with geopy

In the "Third Party Modules" section, we already installed and used the `geopy` library to calculate the distance between two points. Now, we will use another powerful tool hidden inside that same package: the geocoder.

While we could write custom `requests` code to query a geocoding API manually, `geopy` acts as a unified wrapper for dozens of different geocoding services, making the process incredibly smooth. Today, we will use it to access **[Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/)**, which is the free geocoding service powered by OpenStreetMap data.

To get started, we import the `Nominatim` tool from `geopy.geocoders`.

```{code-cell} python
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
```

To use Nominatim, we first need to initialize our geocoder. OpenStreetMap requires us to provide a `user_agent`, which is simply a custom name identifying our application so they know who is making the requests.

```{admonition} Pick a unique name!
:class: warning

Because Nominatim is a free public service, they use the `user_agent` to monitor traffic and prevent abuse. If every student in this course uses the exact same app name, the server might think one person is spamming them and block our access. 

Please change the string below to something unique, such as a random number, your name or whatever.
```

```{code-cell} python
# Initialize the geocoder with a *unique* custom app name
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="sds_course_YOUR_UNIQUE_ID_HERE")
```

---

## 3. Forward geocoding

Forward geocoding is the standard process of going from text to coordinates. We can pass an address or landmark directly to the `.geocode()` method.

```{code-cell} python
# Ask Nominatim to find the Eiffel Tower
location = geolocator.geocode("Eiffel Tower, Paris")

# Check if a location was successfully found
if location:
    print("Address found:")
    print(location.address)
    
    print("\nCoordinates:")
    print(f"Latitude: {location.latitude}")
    print(f"Longitude: {location.longitude}")
else:
    print("Location not found.")
```

Notice that Nominatim returns the full, officially formatted address alongside the exact latitude and longitude.

---

## 4. Reverse geocoding

Sometimes you have a GPS coordinate and you need to know what physical address it corresponds to. This is called **reverse geocoding**.

Using the exact same `geolocator` we initialized above, we can use the `.reverse()` method. We pass the coordinates as a single string formatted as `"latitude, longitude"`.

```{code-cell} python
# A mysterious coordinate in Rome
mystery_coordinate = "41.8775, 12.4736"

# Perform reverse geocoding
location = geolocator.reverse(mystery_coordinate)

print("What is located at this coordinate?")
print(location.address)
```

Just like that, `geopy` asks OpenStreetMap what exists at those exact coordinates, revealing a great pizza restaurant called "[Casa Manco](https://casamanco.it/)"!

---

## 5. API etiquette and rate limiting

Because `geopy` is using Web APIs in the background, all the rules regarding rate limiting from the previous section still apply.

Nominatim is a free service, but it has very strict usage policies. They limit users to **1 request per second**. If you try to geocode a list of 100 addresses instantly using a loop, OpenStreetMap will permanently block your access.

Whenever you need to geocode more than one address, you must use the `time.sleep()` function. Since we are using a loop, this is also a perfect opportunity to bring back the `tqdm` progress bar we learned about recently!

```{code-cell} python
import time
from tqdm import tqdm

places = ["Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Ukraine", "Cu Chi Tunnel, Vietnam", "Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania"]

# Wrap the list in tqdm() for a progress bar
for place in tqdm(places):
    loc = geolocator.geocode(place)
    
    if loc:
        print(f"\n{place} is located at {loc.latitude}, {loc.longitude}")
    
    # Crucial: sleep for 1.5 seconds to respect Nominatim's strict rules
    time.sleep(1.5)
```

## 6. Exercises

Practice translating text to geometry and back again with these exercises.

### Exercise 1: Find your hometown

Use forward geocoding to find the coordinates of your hometown or current university campus.

1. Initialize a `Nominatim` geolocator with a unique `user_agent`.
2. Use `.geocode()` to search for your chosen place.
3. Print the resulting `latitude` and `longitude`.

``````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

# Remember to pick a unique user_agent!
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="sds_exercise_YOUR_ID")

# Replace with your own location
my_location = geolocator.geocode("UZH-Y25, Suisse")

if my_location:
    print(f"Lat: {my_location.latitude}, Lon: {my_location.longitude}")
else:
    print("Location not found.")
```

**Key idea:**
If your search returns an error or `None`, try making your text string more specific by adding the city or country name.
``````

### Exercise 2: Geocoding accident hotspots

You are given a list of coordinates representing prominent traffic accidents in Athens, Greece. To plan effective countermeasures (like installing new warning signs or improving road markings), the city planners need human-readable street addresses, not just GPS coordinates.

Write a loop to reverse-geocode them to find out exactly where these accidents occurred.

1. Loop through the `accident_coords` list.
2. For each coordinate string, use `.reverse()` to find the location.
3. Print the full address so the safety team knows where to go.
4. Add a `time.sleep(1.5)` command to respect Nominatim's strict API limits.

```{code-cell} python
import time
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

# Remember to pick a unique user_agent!
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="athens_safety_YOUR_ID")

# Coordinates of major accidents in Athens
accident_coords = [
    "37.9720, 23.7320",  
    "37.98417, 23.72778",
    "37.976584, 23.725916", 
    "37.98611, 23.72139",   
    "37.99306, 23.72944",   
    "37.99639, 23.72250",   
    "37.98861, 23.72639",   
    "37.976885, 23.740801", 
    "37.986509, 23.734728", 
    "38.002451, 23.733580"  
]

# Your loop goes here
```

``````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
import time
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="athens_safety_YOUR_ID")

accident_coords = [
    "37.9720, 23.7320",  
    "37.98417, 23.72778",
    "37.976584, 23.725916", 
    "37.98611, 23.72139",   
    "37.99306, 23.72944",   
    "37.99639, 23.72250",   
    "37.98861, 23.72639",   
    "37.976885, 23.740801", 
    "37.986509, 23.734728", 
    "38.002451, 23.733580"  
]

for coordinate in accident_coords:
    # Look up the address for the given coordinates
    location = geolocator.reverse(coordinate)
    
    if location:
        full_address = location.address
        print(f"Install road safety signs at: {full_address}\n")
    
    # Pause for 1.5 seconds to respect the server limits
    time.sleep(1.5)
```

**Key idea:**
Reverse geocoding is incredibly useful for enriching raw spatial data (like GPS tracks or accident reports) with human-readable context (like street names and intersections), turning abstract numbers into actionable information for city planners or emergency responders.

## 7. Summary

In this section, you learned how to convert human language into geographic coordinates using community tools.

### Key ideas

* **Forward geocoding** transforms addresses and place names into latitude and longitude coordinates.
* **Reverse geocoding** transforms coordinate pairs into physical street addresses.
* We can reuse the `geopy` library as a helpful wrapper around major geocoding APIs like Nominatim.
* Because geocoding relies on public servers, you must respect **rate limits** by using `time.sleep()` inside your loops.

You now possess the foundational skills to fetch live data from the internet and translate raw addresses into mappable coordinates. Next, we will start introducing tools designed to handle this data in bulk.
